# Imgur Downloder

Imgur Download, by words, is a simple image downloader for [imgur.com](http://imgur.com).
It's not completed yet, but workable now. You can use it to batch download the whole album.

Special thanks to [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) a great boostrap boilerplate.
